# Same application in three ways: An AI travel assistant

This project serves as an investigation of multiple methodologies for implementing an AI assistant. This assistant provides useful answers to travel-related queries.

Getting started with large language modelling and generative AI can be overwhelming due to the wide variety of tools, techniques and methods available. A practical approach to learning is to focus on a straightforward use case and build models from scratch. 

This project is designed as a starting point, providing a learning experience for beginners in the field. Here, the same application has been implemented using three approaches.

## Implementation approaches
1. **Basic**: Uses [chat completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation) API from OpenAI and tool calling.
2. **Agents method**: An multi-agent framework based on chat completions API and tool calling.
3. **LangGraph single-agent**: A single agent graph framework with tool calling implemented using LangChain and LangGraph.
4. **LangGraph multi-agent**: INCOMPLETE. A supervisor-worker graph framework.
